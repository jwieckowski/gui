  "home-text-mcda-1": "Decision-making is an essential part of many processes in everyday life. Both simple everyday problems and complex situations consisting of many factors require the consideration of available decision options in search of the most rational solution.",
  "home-text-mcda-2": "To support the decision-making process, techniques from the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) are used to process the decision-making process in a structured way and propose the most favourable choices. The flow of the main stages of multi-criteria decision analysis can be divided into 4 steps:",

  "home-text-mcda-item-4": "Identification of the most rational choice among the analyzed options",

  "home-text-mcda-3": "MCDA methods can be used for everyday problems. The example can be the selection of electronic equipment (mobile phone, or laptop), where we can indicate the parameters to be considered in the evaluation, and the set of options we want to compare. Then, we specify the preferred direction of the parameter values (when choosing the evaluation criterion 'Price', we may want it to be as low as possible - this means a criterion of the 'Cost' type; when choosing the evaluation criterion 'Memory', we may indicate the criterion type as 'Profit', which will specify the highest possible value). It is also important to indicate the relevance of each parameter in the evaluation, as some parameters may be more important to us than others.",
  "home-text-mcda-4": "Based on this data and the selected methods from the application, we can evaluate the options we have chosen and get information on which options are more preferred than others. Multi-criteria Decision-Making methods can also be used in more complicated and complex problems, such as the selection of material suppliers, the creation of recommender systems, the evaluation of development quality, the selection of rational means of transport and many others. Due to their flexibility and configurable operation, these methods can be applied in many areas where the final choice is influenced by multiple decision criteria.",

  "home-heading-2": "APPLICATION FOR THE DESIGN OF DECISION-MAKING MODELS",

  "home-text-app-1": "The application allows the use of selected techniques from the area of multi-criteria decision making. Actions can be performed on both crisp data and fuzzy sets represented by Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs). Users have access to various methods for entering input data, determining the importance of criteria, and making decisions. It is also possible to determine rankings and compare results in terms of correlations. Additional elements beyond the main functionalities include data standardization methods, distance metrics, selected techniques for calculating crisp values from fuzzy sets, and result visualizations.",
  "home-text-app-2": "The 'About' tab contains a description and examples of creating decision model structures. It presents ways to define individual elements in the structure, from less to more advanced configurations, demonstrating the application's capabilities. Based on the shown examples, you can start designing your own decision models.",
  "home-text-app-3": "In the 'Calculations' tab, a workspace is available where you can design the structure of a decision model that will be used for calculations and determining the most attractive option among the analyzed variants.",
